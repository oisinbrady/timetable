NOTE THIS HAS BEEN UPDATED on 3rd December 2018.

A relatively complex data set and one that is impossible to timetable in semster 1 given the amount of rooms and hours available.
The semester 2 timetable should be empty.
There are a large number of degree schemes, all with students.
The modules are all set to run in semester 1 and they have quite a lot of teaching hours.
Teaching can take place at lots of times over the week.

There is a restricted number of lecture and practical rooms.
But of course, you only need to use rooms data for the extended program.
