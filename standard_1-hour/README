A relatively complete standard data set.
There are a large number of degree schemes.
There are a number of degree schemes without any students.
Most modules are used by several degree schemes.
The modules have the correct amount of teaching time, but now all shown as one hour sessions (so more sessions).
Teaching can take place at lots of times over the week.

There is a restricted number of lecture and practical rooms.
But of course, you only need to use rooms data for the extended program.
For the first section, where you can assume there is an unlimited supply of rooms, your will probably timetable almost all lectures on Mondays!
