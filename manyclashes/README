A relatively complete data set and one that should prove impossible to timetable!.
There are a large number of degree schemes, all with students.
The modules are all set to run in semester 1 and they have lots of teaching hours.
Teaching can take place at lots of times over the week.

There is a restricted number of lecture and practical rooms.
But of course, you only need to use rooms data for the extended program.
For the first section, where you can assume there is an unlimited supply of rooms, your will probably timetable almost all lectures on Mondays!
