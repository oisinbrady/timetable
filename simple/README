A relatively simple data set.
There are only a small number of degree schemes.
Modules are only used by a single degree scheme.
Lots of modules are not used at all.
Teaching can take place at lots of times over the week.

There is a reasonable number of lecture and practical rooms.
And of course, you only need to use rooms data for the extended program.
